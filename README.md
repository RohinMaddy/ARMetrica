# ARMetrica

ARMetrica is an iOS app that leverages the power of Augmented Reality (AR) to measure the length of objects in the real world using your device's camera. Built using Swift and ARKit, ARMetrica provides a simple and intuitive interface for accurately measuring objects without the need for physical measuring tools.

## Features

- **AR Measurement**: Utilizes ARKit to overlay virtual measuring tape on real-world objects, enabling users to measure their length accurately.
- **Simple Interface**: Intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to point, measure, and obtain precise dimensions.
- **Unit Conversion**: Supports multiple units of measurement, including meters, centimeters, feet, and inches, allowing users to choose the unit that suits their needs.
- **Save Measurements**: Users can save measurements for future reference or share them with others via various communication channels.
- **Customization**: Customize the appearance of the measuring tape to suit your preferences.
